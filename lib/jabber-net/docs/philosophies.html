<p>Philosophies to guide Jabber.Net development.</p>
<p>Sure, a lot of these are going to be Mom&amp;ApplePie, but let's get them
down.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scale - scale out first, then scale up</li>
  <li>Latency matters - don't automatically trade latency for scalability or
    fail-over</li>
  <li>Managed - Reuse the existing WinNT/Win2k/WinXP management
    infrastructure.&nbsp; Target typical MCSE's as server admins.&nbsp; Don't
    require hand-editing XML files for standard configurations.</li>
  <li>Reused - don't reinvent the wheel until there is a <i>proven</i> reason to
    do so (e.g. hard performance data pointing to a hot spot).&nbsp; Prefer less
    lines of code.</li>
  <li>Enabled - allow client and server module developers to hook functionality
    in the VS.Net IDE.</li>
  <li>Thread-safe - this thing is going to be maximum-async, so watch for
    correct locking.</li>
  <li>Compatible - maintain <b>all</b> of the client-to-CCM protocol, and create
    a superset of the server-to-module protocol.&nbsp; Try to leverage existing
    modules, but no need to maintain existing configuration file formats,
    etc.&nbsp; As long as there exists a way to hook in existing base-accept and
    base-connect modules, we'll call that good enough.</li>
  <li>Portable - heh.&nbsp; Don't use stuff from the win32 namespace without a
    wrapper.&nbsp; Assume that there will be a .Net runtime on non-MS platforms
    someday.</li>
  <li>Abstract - there are 20+ ways to implement queues.&nbsp; Write an
    interface, and defer the implementation details until later.</li>
</ul>
