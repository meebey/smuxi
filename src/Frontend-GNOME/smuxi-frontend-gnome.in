# Smuxi uses an IPC channel for the single application instance feature and it
# also allows to pass links from commandline to an existing Smuxi instance. This
# IPC channel must be private to the user that executes Smuxi, else other system
# users could control the existing Smuxi instance. Mono doesn't support LOCAL\
# named pipes yet and thus we need to emulate the privateness to the user by
# using a TMP directory that is only readable by the same user who started
# Smuxi. This also workarounds the world-writable unix socket in /tmp issue of
# Mono, see: https://smuxi.im/issues/show/1072
